## Print a Tree in Level Order

Print all the values in a tree in an order based on their level. Nodes in the same level should be printed on the same line. For example, consider the following tree:

<img src="tree.png">

Your algorithm should print the following:

```shell
15
1 17 20
1 5 0 2 5 7
```
